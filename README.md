This notebook calculates a return on investment of trail bridges in Rwanda and Uganda. In this calculation two key variables are, the number of households within a two mile radius and the average distance of these households. This notebook contains a jupyter notebook calculating the population within two miles of bridge sites along with a compiled csv file with the geocoordinates of the bridges and population data.
